# Juicer MKII

The new, Python-based juicer

## Installation

You'll need `lxml`, `libxml2-dev` and `libxslt-dev` for parsing.

For images, `libjpeg-dev`, `zlib1g-dev`, `libpng12-dev`.

The repo comes with `requirements.txt` file for PIP, so you can just do
`pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the Python dependencies.
